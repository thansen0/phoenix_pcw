      <h1>Why We Need Better Parental Control Apps</h1>

      <p>The internet has changed, and current child monitoring apps haven't 
      kept up. We're not just fighting against porn, but we have to compete
      with hundred billion dollar tech companies trying to replace family
      values with more profitable ones.</p>

      <p>Our product focuses on protecting your children from influencers, forms, and communities you deem harmful. Our <%= link "custom filter options", to: ~p"/content_filter_faq" %> are limited but growing while we're in early access. We are a small team and appreciate feature requests! Don't be afraid to <%= link "email us", to: ~p"/contact" %>!</p>
